# CORS Testing Project

This project is designed to test **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** functionality and configurations.

## Overview

CORS is a mechanism that allows web applications running at one origin (domain) to request resources from a different origin (domain). This project helps to test and debug CORS headers and their behavior when making cross-origin requests.

## Quick Setup

If you've done this kind of thing before, you can quickly set up and start testing the CORS functionality in your environment.

### Steps to Get Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dorazez-666/cors-test.git
